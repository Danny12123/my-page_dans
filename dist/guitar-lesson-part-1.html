            <h1>What is music?</h1>
            <p>Before we take a look at how to play the guitar, let take about music. <span>Music</span> is the act of arranging sounds in time though the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. It's one of the universal cultural in every human life. <br> Now we have an idea about what music is, let take a look at instrument. An instrument is an object for producing music, such as a piano, guitar, etc... <br> <strong>In this lessons, we will learn How to play the guitar and at the end of this lesson, there will be a "Test" to see how
            you really find this note helpful.</strong>  </p>
                <h1>Let start with the part of the guitar.</h1>

            <h4>Headstock</h4>
            <p>The Headstock sits at the top of the neck (opposite the body) where the <strong>tuning macjines</strong> and <strong>nut</strong> are installed.</p>

            <h4>Tuning Machines/Tuning Posts</h4>
            <p>On a standard guitar, there are tuning machines which include the tuning posts to hold each string in place and tuning pegs that turn to adjust the tuning.</p>

            <h4>Nut</h4>
            <p>The Nut is a notched piece of plastic or bone installed where the Headstock meets the fretboard of the guitar. The nut has notches where the strings are seared. These notches keep the strings aligned on the fretboard and pay a role in the sting height. </p>

                        <p>The neck of a guitar is the long, thin pice of wood between the Headstock and the body where you'll find the
                            fretboard, frets, and truss rod. Necks are typically attached to the body with bolts, glue, or sometimes both.</p>

            <h4>Fretboard</h4>
            <P>The Fretboard is attached to the top of the neck and is usually made from tonewoods like rosewood, maple, or ebony to prevent dents or warping.The fretboard is a separate piece of wood from the neck and may be the same or a different type of wood, such as a maple fretboard on a maple neck, or a rosewood fretboard on a mahogany neck.</P>
            <h4>Frets</h4>
            <p>Frets are the metal strips running across the fretboard. When a string is pressed down behind a fret, it changes the length of the string and produces a different note. </p>

            <h4>Pickup Selector Switch</h4>
            <p>If your guitar has multiple pickups, a pickup selector Switch allows you to engage single or multiple pickup
            combinationand and a wide range of tones.</p>
            <h4>Knobs/Potentiometers</h4>

            <p>The Potentiometers, often referrd to as pots, control the volume and tone of your guitar. The tone knob(s) allow you to adjust the amount of high frequency, or brightness, of your guitar, While the volume Knobs adjust the overall output of your guitar.</p>
            <h4>Output Jack </h4>
            <p>To get signal out of a guitar, connect one end of a 1/4" guitar cable TS to the output jack and the other end to your amplifier, DI box, pedal or pedalboard, mixer or recording interface.</p>
            <h4>Strap Buttons </h4>

            <!-- some word in music -->
            <h4>Fingerboard</h4>
            <p>The Fingerboard ia an important component of most stringed instruments. It is a thin, long strip of material, usually wood, that is laminated to the front of the neck of an instrument.</p>
            <h4>Key</h4>
            <p>The Key is the root of the scale that a group of chords or notes fall into.</p>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p>Note are single letter on its own sounds different from a word. A note gives a different sound from a chord. When a single string is picked at a time, it called a Note.</p>
            <h4>Root Note</h4>
            <p>In music, a root note is the picth that estabilshes the tone of a musical key, chord, or scale. A root note of a chord gives it a name. For example, in a C major chord, the C note is the root of the chord.</p>
            <h4>chord</h4>
            <p>A chord is a set of note played at a particular time.</p>
            <h4>Strings</h4>
            <p>A guitar string typically consiste of a thin core with wire wrapped around it. The thicker the string or core, the
                lower the pitch. The guitar has 6 strings. They are listed from Low to High, they are: E,A,D,G,B,E.</p>
                <h4>3 WAYS TO MEMORIZE THE GUITAR STRINGS</h4>

            <h2>The Notes On The Guitar</h2>
            <p>There are other ways to start learning the guitar but one of the most important way to start a guitar lessons and to master is to learn the notes on the <span>fretboard.</span> When you start learning the guitar by playing <span>chord</span>, you will still need to know the note to get a clear understanding fo the chord. Well, people use to say the long fretboard scare them off...hahah. It's far easier to learn the fretboard than you might think.</p>
    
            <!-- second_p -->
            <h3>The Musical Alphabet On The Guitar</h3>
            <p>On the guitar, the music alphabet is a little different than the alphabet you learned as a child. With the natural musical alphabet on the guitar, you only have seven notes which are, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. They are called natural since you have no <span>flats</span> or <span>sharps.</span></p>
            <div class="txt_cont">
                <h1><strong>A B C D E F G</strong></h1>
            </div>
            

            <h3>Sharps & Flats</h3>
            <p>Sharps and flats are just half-steps away from the natural notes. The difference between the two is how you move them. When move a half-steps changes the note.</p>

            <h4>Sharps</h4>
            <p>Sharps are a half-steps up from a natural note. The sysbom for sharp is <strong>#</strong>. For instance, a half-step above A is A#</p>
            <div class="txt_cont">
                <h1>
                    # Sharp = Half-Step Up <span>*</span>
                </h1>
            </div>
            <h4>Flats</h4>
            <p>Flats are the opposite of sharps. One half-step down leads to a flat. The sysbom for sharp is <strong>b</strong>. For instance, if you step down from A, you will get Ab.</p>

            <div class="txt_cont">
                <h1> 
                    b Flat = Half-Step Down <span>*</span>
                </h1>
            </div>
            <h1>Intervals</h1>
            <p>An interval is the distance between two notes. In this part, we will only learn about the half and whole step intervals. Since we haven't learned key signatures yet.</p>

            <h4>What are Whole steps and Half step.</h4>
            <p>On the guitar, the notes are determined by what fret you're holding when you pick the string, unlike the piano where each note is represented by pressing a different <span>key.</span></p>

            <h4>Half Step</h4>
            <p>A half step is the shortest distance you can go, so on the guitar it is the distance between one fret and the next fret up or down. For instance, if you are playing tht 3rd frt - low E string, a half step up would be the 4th fret and a half step down would be the 2nd fret on the same string. <span>keep in mind that the distance between an open string and the 1st fret is a half step.</span></p>

            <h4>whole Step</h4>
            <p>A whole step is equivalent to the distance of two half steps. So if you're playing that same not on the 3rd fret - low E string, a whole step up would be the 5th fret and a whole step down would be the 1st fret.</p>

            <p>All the <span>scale</span> on the guitar, we  have an order of whole steps and half steps which repeat over and over again. Well, all the musical alphabet also has an order of whole steps and half step. Once ypu know them and have the understanding of that order, you'll be able to figure out any note on the guitar.</p>
            <div class="txt_cont">
                <h5>This is how it looks like</h5>
                <h1><strong>A BC D EF G</strong></h1>
            </div>
            <h3>The Rule for BC & EF</h3>
            On the guitar and even other insturment, all natural note have have sharps and flats between them except <strong>BC</strong> and <strong>EF.</strong> A half step between these leads to the next natural note. Stepping up from B leads you to C. Stepping down from F leads to E.
